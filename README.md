# linear-regression-taxi-mod
A modified version of the file "linear_regression_taxi.ipynb" distributed by Google CoLabs as a part of their ML Crash Course. 

Features Added/Modified:
* Separated the original code (linear_regression_taxi.ipynb) from my modified code (found in the my-mods directory).
* Broke up the original linear_regression_taxi code into separated .py files. Made the necessary changes so that all the code worked as intended, despite being now separated.
* Saved pre-processing plots, data stats, correlation matrix, and training data as png/csv to figures directory.
* Created experiment specific directories. These directories contain the relevant model information and figures for each run.
